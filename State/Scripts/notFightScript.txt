n*home*none*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*This place... It's where I started.*
n*home*none*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*All that was in this place is a single piece of broccoli.*I couldn't resist. It lured me in.
n*home*none*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Did I start over?*Was all for naught? 
n*home*none*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Samsung bested me. *And I didn't fight back. 
n*home*none*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*But maybe... that gave me another chance.*If I continue on, will I again encounter Samsung?
