n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*So, Broccoli Consumption Man...*You're prepared to give up that easily? 
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*Pathetic. I always knew I was beyond you. *But I thought you'd at least put up a fight. 
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*The last thought left to me...*was a question.
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*What would happen if I lost?*What would happen to the children I swore to protect?
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*All my life, I tried to do good for the world.*
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*When I was a child, my parents died of*broccoli depravation cancer. 
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Ever since then, I didn't ever want another*person to die such a thankless death. 
n*none*bcman*broccoli*Broccoli Consumption Man*So, I swore my life to the noble act*of encouraging the children to eat their broccoli.
n*none*bcman*broccoli*Broccoli Consumption Man*At first, I was hailed as a hero.*The world was at my back. 
n*none*bcman*broccoli*Broccoli Consumption Man*To tell you the truth, I always wanted to be a hero.*
n*none*bcman*broccoli*Broccoli Consumption Man*Child deaths dropped 75% year over year.* 
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Things were going great. Nobody had to bear the same fate*of my parents.
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*But I got too famous. Not everyone agreed with my ideals.*
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*I ignored them.*What I was doing was right.
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*But not everyone felt that way.*
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Forces outside of my control started to grow.*And by the time it was too late, I couldn't stop them.
n*none*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*And for the first time in my life, I was on the losing side of the battle.*
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*none*Broccoli Consumption Man*Samsung...*
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Broccoli Consumption Man*Every time I try to do good in the world now,*you come to knock me back down.

n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*I wore you down over time.*I am your worst nightmare.
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*You were never doing well.*You may have had some minor victories here and there.
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*But I was always there to crush you.*I just wanted to wear you down first.

n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*I just wanted to watch you squirm.*
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*Because I am better than you in every way.*
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*The 2016 HackTheU competition?*Your 4D experience died with a fizzle.

n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*Games4Health 2017?*Heh. You never stood a chance. 
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*I told you you'd win.*But that was a lie. I didn't want the children to live.
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*HackTheU 2018? Not even a single mention.*
n*ruinedWorld*bcman*samsung*Samsung*The deck was stacked.*The game was rigged.
